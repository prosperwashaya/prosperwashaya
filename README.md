## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**prosperwashaya/prosperwashaya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on forest monitoring with remote sensing
ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning a bit of web development and AI
ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on AI, ecology, agriculture
ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with applying deep learning algorithms to satellite imagery analysis
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about GIS, remote sensing techniques, ecological modeling, and sustainable forestry practices
ðŸ“« How to reach me: [your preferred contact method - email/LinkedIn/GitHub]
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns:  leafðŸŒ±/me/alone (when I'm coding)
âš¡ Fun fact: I've identified over 20 different tree species just from satellite imagery patterns!
